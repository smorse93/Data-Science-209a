    "### Predicting admissions into elite universities\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem set we will model the chances of high school students being accepted into two different elite undergraduate colleges (one is elite at least :) ): Harvard and Yale.  The data are provided in the file `data/college_admissions.csv` and were scraped from [collegedata.com](https://www.collegedata.com/) (where applicants volunteer to share their information).  Each observation corresponds to an applicant to one of the two different colleges (note: the same applicant may show up in two rows: once for each college).  The main response is the `admitted` variable (1 = admitted, 0 = denied), and there are are several predictors to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **id**: a unique identifier for the applicant \n",
    "- **test**: a standardized measurement of the applicants highest ACT or SAT combined score (2400 is the maximum). \n",
    "- **ap**: the number of AP tests taken\n",
    "- **avg_ap**: the average score on the AP tests taken (0 if no tests were taken)\n",
    "- **sat_subjects**: the number of SAT subject tests taken\n",
    "- **gpa**: the unweighted GPA of applicant (max of 4.0)\n",
    "- **female**:  a binary indicator for gender: 1 = female, 0 = otherwise \n",
    "- **minority**: a binary indicator for under-represented minority: 1 = minority, 0 = otherwise \n",
    "- **international**: a binary indicator for international status: 1 = international, 0 = US\n",
    "- **sports**: a binary indicator for HS All-American: 1 = all-American athlete, 0 = otherwise\n",
    "- **school**: a categorical variable for school applied to: \"Harvard\" or \"Yale\"\n",
    "- **early_app**: a binary indicator for application type: 1 = early action, 0 = regular\n",
    "- **alumni**:  a binary indicator for parents' alumni status of school: 1 = a parent is an alumnus, 0 = otherwise\n",
    "- **program**: the program applied to by the student with many choices (we will not use this as a predictor)\n",
    "- **add_info**: additional (optional) info provided by applicant (we will not use this as a predictor)\n",
    "\n",
    "The main set of 12 predictors is (note: you may need to modify this list when fitting different models, and your will be replacing the `school` variable with a binary `harvard` variable early in the questions below):\n",

Please be certain provide clarifying labels for all printed numbers and limit the number of digits showing after decimals to a reasonable length (e.g. 4 decimal points for coefficients and accuracy scores).**\n",

Test is still more important to the admission probability since the scale of the test numbers is much larger than those of the avg_ap scores. You can see that there appears to be some collinearity at play between test and avg_ap."

The accuracies of the two models are the same from 2_1 to 2_3, I think that the collinearity of test scores and avg ap may have some role to play in it, alongside what I am interpretting as a low importance with regard to the weight of avg_ap relative to test in our models when they were generated?"

    "**4.1** You were instructed to NOT scale predictors in the prior sections above. The primary reason for this was to focus instead on the interpretability of our logistic regression coefficients. However, as we're sure you noticed, the numeric scale among our different predictors varies greatly (i.e. `test` values are in the 1,000's while others are much, much smaller). In practice, we might want to put our predictors all on a similar scale, particularly for regression and/or distance-based algorithms such as $k$-NN classification. (1) Please explain why scaling under these circumstances might be important. Then, (2) actually apply standardized scaling to all of the **non-binary** predictors in our original set of 12 predictors (for both the training and test sets).\n",

However, as we're sure you noticed, the numeric scale among our different predictors varies greatly (i.e. `test` values are in the 1,000's while others are much, much smaller). In practice, we might want to put our predictors all on a similar scale, particularly for regression and/or distance-based algorithms such as $k$-NN classification. (1) Please explain why scaling under these circumstances might be important. Then, (2) actually apply standardized scaling to all of the **non-binary** predictors in our original set of 12 predictors (for both the training and test sets).\n",

The K=1 model was technically the worst, but I don't think that's in the spirit of the question. It seems that finding the most important variables and isolating their interactions ia good method in general. knn also had great results. I may have misinterpretted the question in 1.1, but its clear that the sophisticated model performs much better. These models provide us much more insight into what is actually happening and what is being considered in the admissions process when compared to 1.1."

The rest are about what I expected, the area under the graph for the KNN is smaller than I expected. They are close to matching the classification accuracy mix, but just slightly different. I guess this difference can be attributed to the difference in accuracy measurement implimented. I'm not super certain which would be better "
